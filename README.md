Mahjong is a 4-player Chinese tile game. Our project will focus on the Hong Kong variant [1] without flowers and seasons, with a total of 136 tiles with various patterns. The goal of the game is to end with a winning hand: four sets of chow (3 tiles in an incremental run), pung (3 identical tiles), or kong (4 identical tiles), and a pair (2 identical tiles). 

At each turn in Mahjong, a player draws a tile (bringing their hand to 14 tiles) and must immediately discard one tile (returning to 13 tiles). The fundamental optimization problem we address is: which tile should be discarded to maximize the probability of achieving a winning hand in the minimum number of turns? This decision is critical because it directly impacts the player's path to victory, yet the optimal choice is far from obvious due to the complex interactions between tiles in hand, tiles already discarded, and tiles that may arise in future turns.

This is an optimization problem, because players must choose from possible discards subject to clear constraints: maintaining tile number, ensuring the final hand satisfies the 4-sets-plus-pair structure, and limiting draws to tiles not already discarded. The decision space is large with many hand configurations, and decisions have long-term consequences. Human intuition is often locally optimal but globally suboptimal, and brute force evaluation is not feasible. Simple heuristics cannot capture particular tile dependences. The key characteristics of Mahjong make it ideal for optimization techniques - it is a multi-stage sequential decision problem with uncertainty in tile draws, well-defined constraints, and measurable performance metrics for comparing strategies.
